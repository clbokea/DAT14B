      In this exercise you are going to create a login application
      that checks if the pincode typed by the user is correct.
      If correct the user should be granted access to the system
      (symbolized by a system.out.println("You are in");)
      If not, the user should get an error message
      
      You are going to use
      1. A scanner object (to get the pincode typed in the console)
      2. IF/Else statements (to check if the pin is correct)
      You decide what the correct pincode is.

      // Then ask for the pin code
      
      // Get what the user typed in the console
      
      // check if the pincode is correct
      // if it is "grant access"
      // If not give an error message
