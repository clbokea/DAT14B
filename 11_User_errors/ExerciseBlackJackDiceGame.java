      // 2.MACHINE THROWS
      // This is more or less the same procedure as above
      // but you do not ask the machine if it wants to go on.
      // You have to set up some rules (algorithm) that makes 
      // the machine go on or stop.
      // And remember that if the user got 21, 
      // then the machine have already lost.
      // And if the user exeeded 21, then the machine have already won
      
      
      
            
      // 3.CHECK WHO WON
      // Here you will have to check:
      // 1. Did the user get 21, then he wins
      // 2. did the user exeed 21, then machine wins
      // 3. did the machine exeed 21, then user wins
      // 4. is the users sum larger than the machines, the user win
      // 5. is the machine sum larger than users, then machine win
      // 6. did user and machine get the same sum, then it is a draw
